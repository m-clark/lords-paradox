The following is a summary of Pearl's 2014 and 2013 technical reports on some modeling situations that lead to surprising results that are initially at odds with out intuition.

# Lord's Paradox
## Background

Two statisticians are interested in determining whether there are differences among males and females in weight gain over the course of semester.  In the original depiction by Lord, there is an implication of some diet treatment, but all that can be assumed is that those under consideration both received the 'treatment' if there was one.  The two statisticians take different approaches to examining the data, yet come to different conclusions.

### Variables
- sex
- weight time 1
- weight time 2
- weight change

### Issues
The following graph is from Pearl 2014. The ellipses represent the scatter plots for boys and girls.  The diagonal 45^o^ degree line would represent no change from time 1 to time 2.  The center of the ellipses are both on this line, and thus the mean change for boys and girls are identical and zero.  The density plot in the lower left depicts the distribution of change scores centered on this zero estimate.

## Results

Statistician 1 focuses on change scores, while statistician 2 uses an ANCOVA to examine sex differences at time 2 while adjusting for initial weight.

- t-test for group difference on change score vs. ANCOVA approach
- Statistician 1 concludes no difference in *change*
- Statistician 2 concludes a difference in time 2 if controlling for time 1

### DAG

The model can be depicted as a directed acyclic graph as follows.


```{r dag1}
library(DiagrammeR)
grViz("
digraph dag1 {

  # a 'graph' statement
  graph [fontsize = 10, layout=circo] #rankdir ignored for circo

  # several 'node' statements
  Change[shape = doublecircle, fontname = Helvetica, fontcolor='gray50', fillcolor='gray95', width=1, penwidth=0.2];
  node [shape = box, fontname = Helvetica, fontcolor='gray50', style=filled, penwidth=0]
  Sex[color=lightsalmon]; 
  Initial[color=navajowhite]; 
  Final[color=navajowhite]; 


  # edge statements
  Sex -> Initial[label='a' fontcolor='gray25'  color='dodgerblue'] 
  Sex->Final [label='b' fontcolor='gray25'  color='darkred']
  Initial->Final [label='c' fontcolor='gray25'  color='dodgerblue']
  Initial->Change [label='-1' color='gray75' fontcolor='gray25'  ]
  Final->Change [label='+1' color='gray75' fontcolor='gray25'  ]
}
")

```


In the above we can define the following effects of sex on final weight, or on change through effects on initial and final weight.

- <span style="color:#1e90ff">**Indirect effect**</span>: is a*c
- <span style="color:#8b0000">**Direct effect**</span>: b
- <span style="color:#66023C">**Total effect**</span>: (a\*-1) + (a\*c\*1) + (b\*1)

Gain is completely determined as the difference between final weight and initial weight, and so its direct effects from initial and final weight are not estimated, but fixed to -1 and +1 respectively.  To calculate the total effect of Sex on weight gain, we must sum all the paths from Sex to it- from sex-final-gain, sex-initial-gain, sex-initial-final-gain.

### Who is *correct*?

- Both statisticians are correct
- t-test on change = total effect
- ANCOVA = direct effect

In summary, the two statisticians are focused on different effects from the same model- one the total effect, the other the direct effect.

## Data Example

We can get an explicit sense of the results by means of a hands on example.  In the following we have simulated data that will reproduce the situation described thus far.  Parameters were chosen for visual and statistical effect.  One thing that's not been noted about the example is that it likely would not occur, in the sense that the total effect would likely be positive, as there would be strong sex differences at initial weight, and a strong correlation between initial and final weight, all in a positive manner (and not construed in a way to nullify the effect). The other issue not addressed is that the entire focus on whether an effect exists hinges on p-values, and with large enough data and such simple models, impractical effects could flag significant. Plus there are other general modeling issues ignored. A goal here is conceptual simplicity however.

```{r dataSetup, echo=1:8}
set.seed(1234)
N = 200
group  = rep(c(0, 1), e=N/2)
initial = .75*group + rnorm(N, sd=.25)
final = .4*initial + .5*group + rnorm(N, sd=.1)
change = final-initial
df = data.frame(id=factor(1:N), group=factor(group, labels=c('Female', 'Male')), initial, final, change)
head(df)

library(dplyr)
dflong = tidyr::gather(df, key=time, value=score, initial:final) %>% arrange(id)
head(dflong)
```


```{r plotData}
library(ggplot2); library(plotly); library(dplyr)
 
# plot_ly(filter(dflong, group=='Female'), x=time, y=score, group=id, mode='line', showlegend=F, line=list(color='#ff5500')) %>% 
#   add_trace(data=filter(dflong, group=='Male'), x=time, y=score, group=id, showlegend=F, line=list(color='dodgerblue'))

coefm = coef(lm(final~initial, filter(df, group=='Male')))
coeff = coef(lm(final~initial, filter(df, group=='Female')))
g = ggplot(aes(x=initial, y=final), data=df) +
  geom_abline(intercept=0, slope=1, color='gray50', alpha=.5) +
  geom_point(aes(color=group), alpha=.5) +
  stat_ellipse(aes(color=group), level=.999) +
  # geom_smooth(aes(color=group), method='lm', se=F) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c('#ff5503', 'dodgerblue')) +
  geom_abline(intercept=coefm[1], slope=coefm[2], color='dodgerblue') +
  geom_abline(intercept=coeff[1], slope=coeff[2], color='#ff5503') +
  lazerhawk::theme_trueMinimal()
ggplotly(g)

```

<br>
In the following we'll use lavaan to estimate the full mediation model, then run separate regressions to demonstrate the t-test on change vs. the ANCOVA approach.  For the mediation model, we only need to estimate the relevant effects on initial and final weight.  As noted above, the t-test on change score measures the total effect of sex, while the ANCOVA measures the direct effect on final weight. It is unnecessary to distinguish them as separate modeling approaches, as they are merely standard regressions with different target variables.  

```{r runModels, echo=T}
mod = "
  initial ~ a*group
  final ~ b*group + c*initial
  # change ~ -1*initial + 1*final   (implied)
 
  # total effect
  TE := (a*-1) + (a*c*1) + (b*1)  # using tracing rules
"

library(lavaan)
lpmod = sem(mod, data=df)

summary(lpmod)
summary(lm(change ~ group, df))             # t-test on change scores = total effect
summary(lm(final ~ group + initial, df))    # 'ancova' uncovers direct effect etc.
```

 
### Aside

We can model the change score while adjusting for initial weight (and we should generally). Note that the coefficient for initial weight `r round(coef(lm(change~group+initial, df))[3],2)` is equivalent to the ANCOVA coefficient (`r round(coef(lm(final~group+initial, df))[3],2)`) minus 1. One way to think about this is just as we have been, but focus on the initial weight score instead of the coefficient for sex.  The indirect effect on change through final weight is its coefficient (path **c**) times +1, but the total effect includes the indirect plus the direct effect (i.e. direct effect - 1).

The change score result duplicates the ANCOVA result for the group effect. In fact all coefficients for covariates would be identical in a model for final weight vs. weight gain, as long as the baseline value is controlled for.  They are the direct effects for a model with final weight times + 1.  

See for example, Laird 1983.

```{r changewithAdjust}
summary(lm(change ~ group + initial, df))
```


## Treatment with confounding

### Background
Wainer & Brown 2007 took a different interpretation of the paradox. Here we can think of a similar situation, but instead of sex differences we now have a group difference regarding whether one dines in a particular room[^wb].

### Variables
- weight time 1
- weight time 2
- weight change
- room A vs. B



### Issues

Visually we can depict it as before but showing the difference. The choice of comic sans font in the graph is due to Wainer and Brown and should be held against them.

<img src="img/lp2.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;">



- Heavier kids more likely to sit at table B
- Two statisticians come the conclusions as before



### Results

The DAG makes clear the difference in the model compared to the previous scenario.

```{r dag2}
grViz("
digraph dag2 {

  # a 'graph' statement
  graph [fontsize = 10, layout=circo] #rankdir ignored for circo

  # several 'node' statements
  Change[shape = doublecircle, fontname = Helvetica, fontcolor='gray50', fillcolor='gray95', width=1, penwidth=0.2];
  node [shape = box, fontname = Helvetica, fontcolor='gray50', style=filled, penwidth=0]
  Group[color=lightsalmon]; 
  Initial[color=navajowhite]; 
  Final[color=navajowhite]; 


  # edge statements
  Initial -> Group[label='a' fontcolor='gray25'  color='dodgerblue'] 
  Group->Final [label='b' fontcolor='gray25'  color='darkred']
  Initial->Final [label='c' fontcolor='gray25'  color='dodgerblue']
  Initial->Change [label='-1' color='gray85' fontcolor='gray25'  ]
  Final->Change [label='+1' color='gray85' fontcolor='gray25'  ]
}
")

```
<br>

- Weight time 1 is now a confounder
- Arrow *from* time 1 to 'treatment'
- Statistician 1 concludes no change
- Statistician 2 concludes a difference (seen next)

<img src="img/lp2_afteradj.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;">


While Wainer and Brown again suggest that both statisticians are correct, Pearl disagrees. Statistician 1 is incorrect because they do not adjust for the confounder, which is necessary to determine causal effects.  

Note that both paradox scenarios presented assume no latent confounders. If present then both statisticians are potentially wrong in both cases. As depicted however, it was not the case that two legitimate methods gave two different answers to the same research question, as Lord concluded originally.



## Birth Weight Paradox

### Background
The problem discussed thus far extends beyond controlling for baseline scores to involving any covariate, where the focus on change scores isn't even possible[^lord].

Here we are concerned with the relationship of birth weight and infant mortality rate. In general, low birth weight is associated with higher likelihood of death.  The paradox arises from the fact that low birth weight children born to smoking mothers have a lower mortality rate.

### Variables
- birth weight
- smoking mom
- infant mortality
- other causes

### Issues
- No difference score
- Before, focus on clash between two seemingly legitimate methods of analysis
- Now using a single standard regression approach but results seem implausible


### Results

- low birth weight children have higher mortality rate (100 fold higher)
- children of smoking mothers notably more likely to have low birth weight
- low birth weight children born to smoking mothers have a lower mortality rate
- Conclusion: expectant mothers should start smoking?!


### Explanation

#### Collider bias (explain away effect)

The DAG for this situation is depicted as follows. Smoking does have an effect on birth weight and infant mortality, but so do a host of other variables, at least some of which are far more detrimental.

```{r dagBirthweight}
grViz("
digraph dagbw {

  # a 'graph' statement
  graph [fontsize = 10, layout=circo] #rankdir ignored for circo

  # several 'node' statements
  node [shape = box, fontname = Helvetica, fontcolor='gray50', style=filled, penwidth=0]
  Other[color=navajowhite]; 
  BW[color=lightsalmon]; 
  Smoking[color=navajowhite]; 
  Death[color=navajowhite]; 


  # edge statements
  edge [color='gray50']
  Smoking->BW Other->BW 
  BW->Death Smoking->Death Other->Death
}
")
```

<br>
Pearl explains the result from two perspectives.

#### Perspective 1
What is the causal effect of birth weight on death?

- Birth weight is confounded by smoking and other causes
- Controlling just for smoking leaves other causes, resulting in bias
- In addition, controlling for smoking changes the probability of other causes (due to BW collider) for any stratum of BW
-- Example: for BW='low', if we compare smoking vs. non-smoking mothers, we are also comparing situations where other causes are rare vs. one where other causes are likely, thus leading to the paradoxical conclusion.

#### Perspective 2
What is the causal effect of smoking on death?

Another perspective is from the point of Lord's paradox. Here we are concerned with the effect of smoking on mortality above and beyond its effect though birth weight (i.e. the mediation context of previous).  Unlike before (or at least what was assumed before), here we have other confounders.

In this case, adjusting for birth weight doesn't sever all paths though the mediator, and actually opens up a new path, and the effect is now spurious.

```{r dagbw2, fig.align='center'}
grViz("
digraph dagbw2 {

  # a 'graph' statement
  graph [fontsize = 10, layout=circo] #rankdir ignored for circo

  # several 'node' statements
  node [shape = box, fontname = Helvetica, fontcolor='gray50', style=filled, penwidth=0]
  Other[color=navajowhite]; 
  Death[color=navajowhite]; 
  BW[color=lightsalmon]; 
  Smoking[color=navajowhite]; 


  # edge statements
  edge [color='gray50']
  Smoking->BW Other->BW 
  Other->Death
}
", height=200)
```

<br>

Essentially we end up in the same situation.  By conditioning on birth weight == 'low', it does not physically keep birth weight from changing. Comparison of smoking vs. non-smoking leads to a comparison of infants with no other causes vs. those with other causes.

# Simpson's Paradox


## Description
Simpson's paradox refers to a general phenomenon of reversal of results from what is expected. Lord's paradox can be seen as a special case, and while we have gone through the details of that particular aspect, we can describe Simpson's paradox with a simple example.

Consider a treatment given to males and females with the following success rates:

```{r simpsonExampleFreq}
# vals = data.frame(Sex=c('Male','Female'), Control=c('234/270','55/80'), Treamtent=c('81/87','192/263'))
# vals2 = data.frame(Sex=c('Male','Female'), 
#                    Control=round(c(234/270,55/80),2), 
#                    Treamtent=round(c(81/87,192/263), 2))

vals =data.frame(Sex=c('Male','Female'), 
                 Control=c('23/27','5/8'), 
                 Treatment=c('8/9','19/26'))
vals2 = data.frame(Sex=c('Male','Female'), 
                   Control=round(c(23/27,5/8),2), 
                   Treatment=round(c(8/9,19/26), 2))
htmlTable::htmlTable(vals, rnames=F, 
                     css.table='margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; border:none;width:50%')
```

<br>

```{r simpsonExampleProps}
htmlTable::htmlTable(vals2, rnames=F, 
                     css.table='margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; border:none;width:50%')
```

<br>

And what are the total results across male and females?

<br>

```{r simpsonExampleAggregate}
vals = data.frame(Sex=c('All', ''),
                  Control=c('28/35','80%'), 
                  Treatment=c('27/35','77%'))
htmlTable::htmlTable(vals, rnames=F, 
                     css.table='margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; border:none;width:50%')
```

<br>

So we are back to our low birth weight issue.

Pearl notes three things are required for resolving such a paradox.

- The solution must explain why the results are seen to be surprising
- The solution must identify those cases where the paradox will arise
- The solution must provide a means for making a *correct* decision

## Surprise

The surprise is as we have just noted.  We see individual proportion results, but the sum of those proportions leads to a different conclusion, thus invoking surprise.  The 'paradox' isn't really a paradox, as the result is just arithmetic.  However, the surprise it invokes tends us toward thinking of it as such.  Our intuition tells us that, for example, a drug can't be harmful to both men and women but good for the population as a whole.  This is in fact the case, but statistically it can happen if we aren't applying an appropriate model.

Pearl's sure thing theorem:

> An action A that increase the probability of event B in each subpopulation must also increase the probability of B in the whole population, *provided that the action does not change the distribution of the subpopulations*.

In other words, regardless if some effect Z is a confounder or not, and even if we don't have the correct causal structure, such reversal should invokes suspicion rather than surprise.  In the above example, simply having appropriate amounts of data would likely be enough to rule out a reversal.


## Reversal

In the following graphical models we have some treatment X, and some recovery Y, with an additional covariate Z. In addition, for some we have some additional latent variable(s) L[^pearlL].

## Decision

Pearl suggests using the back-door criterion in order to help us make a decision, summarized as follows:

- Paths between X and Y are of two kinds, causal and spurious
    - Causal paths can be traced as arrows from X to Y
    - Spurious paths need to be blocked by conditioning
    - All paths containing an arrow *into* X are spurious
  
- In the case of a singleton covariate Z, we must ensure that
    - Z is not a descendant of X
    - Z blocks every path that ends with an arrow into X

- Collider variables are a special case in which they block the path when they and all their descendants are *not* conditioned on.

This leads to the following conclusions:

- In set 1 we need to condition on Z in **a** and **d** (blocking the back door path $X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y$).  We would not in **b** and **c** because in **b**, there are no back door paths, and in **c** the backdoor path is blocked when not conditioned on.

- When conditioning on Z is required, the Z specific information carries the correct information.  However in other cases, e.g. Set 1 graph **c**, and Set 2 graphs **a** and **c**, the aggregated information is correct because the spurious path $X \rightarrow Z \leftarrow Y$ is blocked if Z is not conditioned on.

- In some cases there is not enough information with Z to block potential back-door paths, as in Set 2 **b**.



# Summary

Unfortunately most modeling situations are much more complex than the simple scenarios depicted. Most of the time experiment is not an option, and the nature of the relationships of variables ambiguous, leaving any causal explanation an impossible prospect.  However, even in those situations, thinking causally can help our general understanding, and perhaps make some of these 'surprising' situations less so.
